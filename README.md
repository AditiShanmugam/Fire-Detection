# Fire Detection system using Computer Vision 
Accidental fires are one of the biggest challenges in disaster control. They are highly uncertain and can occur in forests, workplace, industries and households to name a few. Uncontrolled fires can quickly turn into massive conflagrations, and cause immense damage to biological life, goods, establishments and the environment. This places an importance on the development of efficient fire detection systems that can quickly identify fires as soon as it starts, especially in remote locations such as forests and grasslands. Conventional detection systems mainly rely on temperature or smoke to physically reach the sensors in order to invoke a response may delay the process of identifying the outbreak of an uncontrolled fire. Advancements in the field of computer vision at breakneck speeds over the last few decades have given rise to CNN architectures that can visually identify objects efficiently, these concepts can be used to detect smoke in a fraction of the time taken by its conventional fire detection counterparts. Liu and Ahuja, 2004 and Enis Çetin et al., 2013 propose two such methodologies. Arson and the lack of education about fire emergency protocols also contribute to the occurrence and poor management of accidental fires.


Here is all the MATLAB code I used to develop a fire detection system using computer vision.
